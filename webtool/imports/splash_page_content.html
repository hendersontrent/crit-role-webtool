      <h1>Welcome to the Critical Role Statistical Visualiser</h1>
      <p>This tool leverages data collected by Critical Role Stats to build statistical models and data visualisations for a variety of things including dice rolls, damage dealt, healing given, and much more. This web application may time out if left idle for too long. The application is not optimised for mobile viewing and is best viewed on a computer. Currently, only data for The Mighty Nein is in the application. Data will be updated after each episode. Enjoy!
