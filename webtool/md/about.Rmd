## Critical Role Statistical Analysis Tool
***

### What is this application?

This is a web application created to enable interactive exploration of data collected for the show [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/). The application visualises and models data regarding dice rolls, damage dealt, healing given, among much more. It is a continuous work-in-progress, and more features will be progressively added. 


### How do I use it?

Navigate through the app using the tabs at the top. Further details and instructions are provided on each tab. A high level overview of what each does presented below:

* __CHARACTER ANALYSIS__ Presents character-level analysis and visualisation of dice roll data.
* __STATISTICAL MODELLING__ Presents handwritten Bayesian state space probabilistic models of damage dealt and healing given by episode.
